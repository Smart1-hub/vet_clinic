## Vet-Clinic: DB

This project is a relational database for a vet clinic. Some new tables and foreign key columns are added to the existing animals table to model one-to-many relationships. Afterward, JOIN is used to query the data.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
